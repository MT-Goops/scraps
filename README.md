# Scraps
Very simple Minetest mod that allows to recycle metal tools

## "If you don't use it, then burn it !"
Put into furnace, the handles of the tools will be burned, but the head of the tool will give scraps/shards/fragments, that can then be put together in order to recover some part of the materials used to craft the tool.
